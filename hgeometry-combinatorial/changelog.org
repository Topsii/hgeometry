#+STARTUP: showeverything

* Changelog

** 0.12

- Add Data.Double.Approximate: Floating point numbers take take
  imprecision into account when ordering.
- Add Data.Double.Shaman: Floating point numbers that keep track of
  error bounds while not being more than an order of magnitude slower
  than native floating point numbers.
- Add Data.PlanarGraph.Immutable and Data.PlanarGraph.Mutable: New
  planargraph implementation that supports efficient updates and queries.

** 0.11

- Changed the implementation of Two and Three in Data.Util
  (hgeometry-combinatorial). Now they have proper Functor, Foldable,
  and Traversable instances.
- Added Data.RealNumber.Rational wrapping the Rational type giving
  some more readable show/read instances
- Added function to compute levels in a Rose-Tree
- Moved the binary searching functions from Data.Sequence.Util into
  Algorithms.BinarySearch, also added a version for fractional types
  that stops at a given threshold.
- Removed Data.BalBST and Data.SlowSeq
- Moved Measured from Data.BinaryTree into a separate module.

** 0.10

- More Instances

** 0.9

- First release in which hgeometry-combinatorial was split off from hgeometry.
