-- TODO: We seem to assume that no four points are coplanar, and no
-- three points lie on a vertical plane. Figure out where we assume that exactly.

-- no four points coplanar:
--     - otherwise events may happen simultaneously
--     - output may not be a set of triangles
-- no three points on a vertical plane:
--     Otherwise the test for computing the next time t does not exist
--       (slope of the supp. plane of three such points is +infty)


-- TODO: The kinetic sim. now treats three points on a vertical plane
-- as happening at time t=-\infty. That means we should find faces on
-- the lower envelope that have that property separately.
--
-- I think we can do that by projecting the points down onto the
-- xy-plane, and computing a 2D convex hull.
--
-- I Think this is actually fine, since for s.t. like the delaunay
-- triangulation you don't want those faces anyway.

-- FIXME: We start with some arbitrary starting slope. Fix that
